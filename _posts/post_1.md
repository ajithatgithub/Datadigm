challenge: "A leading Retailer with chains of stores across US, lacked executive view across the business network with the distributed data that was making it impossible to view key metrics, gain insights,. They wanted to improve the sub-optimal mobile features in the existing BI platform while dealing with the increasing cost of 3rd party tools, high time to market for reporting requests, and poor user experience with reports."
